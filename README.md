Setup flask page to let the user build and add classes to mongodb. When in the schedule builder page it will load the mongodb classes into the knowledgebase using prolog.assertz.

Then it will consult scheduler.pl to query for class times using prolog.query.

Will then display times to webpage with beautifying in the future.
